Vehicle and fleet trackers connect to a power source and send continuous location and performance data through GPS tracking software. Battery-powered trackers are portable and work well for assets like trailers or containers that sit idle for long periods. Personal GPS tracking devices are compact units used for employees, seniors, or family members. Some GPS tracking services combine solar or hybrid-powered options for long-term outdoor monitoring. All offer real time GPS tracking and reporting through an online dashboard or mobile app."
