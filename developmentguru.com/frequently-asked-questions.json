        "text": "Managed IT Services refer to outsourcing your IT infrastructure and support to a dedicated provider who proactively monitors, maintains, and secures your systems. This helps prevent issues instead of only reacting when something breaks. At Development Guru, we use an Assess → Implement → Maintain model and best-in-class tools such as SentinelOne, Microsoft 365 and Azure, Veeam, and Datto to improve reliability, security, and performance for your business."

An MSP like Development Guru reduces downtime, improves security, and manages platforms such as Fortinet firewalls, Okta or Duo multi-factor authentication, SentinelOne endpoint protection, and Microsoft 365 so you can focus on running your business."
